# F-MA-quizzing-app-project
This project is open for anyone who is passionate about technology and believe that we can use the power of our code to build things to solve problem around us. This project is meant to inspire developer to contribute to their community by writting programs that solve important problems. 

The application was purposely built to create transparency and efficiency within the quizzing community in Liberia. The app has features that can be used to keep track of the quizzing game. The application was created to be played with the rules of quizzing in Liberia. For the most part the app can be use anywhere once the user follow the rules. 

As the author of this program I believe that we should push ourselves beyond boundaries and encourage other to do so. I believe that this application is going to encourage academic excellence and encourage academician and students to get excited for academic events.
